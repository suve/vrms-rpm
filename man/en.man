.TH VRMS-RPM 1
.SH NAME
vrms-rpm - report of installed non-free software
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvrms-rpm\fR \fI[OPTION]\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a clone of the original
\fBvrms\fR ("\fBvirtual Richard M. Stallman\fR")
program for Debian GNU/Linux, created with the purpose of bringing its 
brilliant idea over to RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions.
.PP
This program analyses the list of currently installed RPM packages and reports
found non-free packages to stdout. The decision on whether to classify a package
as free or non-free is based on the Fedora Project licensing guidelines.
.PP
Fedora / CentOS users using additional repositories, such as \fBRPM Fusion\fR, 
may notice that not all packages coming from non-official repos are marked as 
non-free. This is because the distinction, as noted before, is made depending 
on the package licence. There are various reasons, apart from licensing, why 
a package may not have been accepted into the official 
Fedora / CentOS repository – such as software patents or export restrictions.
.PP
Richard Stallman has been, for years, the most prominent and vocal figure 
in the Free Software movement, relentlessly reminding us on issues of 
software ethics. Like Richard, we believe that users should have an easy way to
know whether they’re running non-free software on their systems. 
This program is an attempt to fulfil that need.
