# vrms-rpm

A clone of *vrms* ("*virtual Richard M. Stallman*") for
RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions.

This program analyses the list of currently installed RPM packages and reports
found non-free packages to stdout. 


### Why a clone instead of a fork?

Because my only experience with Perl (which the original *vrms* is written in)
has been one semester of Operating Systems class, and that was a long time ago.

Also, seeing how much the resulting program differs from the original, it's
quite possible that making a fork instead of starting fresh would only
complicate matters. After all, removing code is hard.


### Installing from a repository

Fedora users can install *vrms-rpm* from the official distro repository.
RHEL/CentOS users can get the package from the Fedora EPEL repositories.
```
$ dnf install vrms-rpm
```
You can also grab the package from the *copr* repository 
[suve/vrms-rpm](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/suve/vrms-rpm/).


### Building it on your own: dependencies

- *bash*, since 'tis a shell script

- *grep*, for all that nifty pattern matching

- *gettext*, for handling multiple languages

- *make*, for simplifying the build & install process


### Building

Right now you're probably wondering why the hell do you need to build a 
bash script. Well, basically we need to process the gettext translation
files and set up data paths.

At this point you should've already decided where do you want to install
the program. As stated before, some paths are set in the code during build,
so if these don't match during build and install, the whole thing will
probably fail spectacularly in runtime.

To build, use `make` with the `build` target. The `PREFIX` variable can be
used for controlling the install-dir. The default is `/usr/local`.
```
$ make build [PREFIX=/usr/local]
```


### Installing

To install, perform your usual `make install`.
```
$ [sudo] make install [PREFIX=/usr/local]
```
Remember that to install stuff inside `/usr` you will need root capabilities.


### Getting rid of it

Should you decide to remove the program, the Makefile has got you covered.
```
$ [sudo] make remove [PREFIX=/usr/local]
```
Once again, remember that messing inside `/usr` requires extra privileges.
