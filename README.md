**vrms-rpm**
----------
A clone of *vrms* ("*virtual Richard M. Stallman*") for
RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions.

This program analyses the list of currently installed RPM packages and reports
found non-free packages to stdout. 


**Why a clone instead of a fork?**
----------
Because my only experience with Perl (which the original *vrms* is written in)
has been one semester of Operating Systems class, and that was a long time ago.

Also, seeing how much the resulting program differs from the original, it's
quite possible that making a fork instead of starting fresh would only
complicate matters. After all, removing code is hard.


**Installing from a repository**
----------
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/vrms-rpm.svg?minversion=2.1)](https://repology.org/metapackage/vrms-rpm)    
Fedora users can install *vrms-rpm* from the official distro repository.
RHEL/CentOS users can get the package from the Fedora EPEL repositories.
```
$ dnf install vrms-rpm
```


**Building it on your own: dependencies**
----------
- `bash`, as there are some shell scripts used during the build process

- `sed` - used in the aforementioned shell scripts

- `make`, for simplifying the build & install process

- `gcc`, although clang should work too

- `gettext` (`libintl`), for handling multiple languages

- `librpm` (**optional**), for accessing RPM's functions for comparing package versions

- `cmocka` (**optional**), for running the test suite


**Picking the licence list**
----------
*vrms-rpm* works by analysing the list of installed packages (as reported by *rpm*)
and comparing their licences to a list of known good licences. Since distributions
can have differing opinions on what constitutes as free software,
and what the licence tags should be written as (e.g. "GPLv2" vs "GPL-2.0"),
*vrms-rpm* comes packaged with several different licence lists.

These are:

- `fedora` - a list created in accordance to the [Fedora Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Good_Licenses).

- `spdx-fsf-and-osi` - a list created in accordance to the [SPDX licence list](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Includes only licences marked as both "FSF free/libre" and "OSI approved".

- `spdx-fsf-or-osi` - a list created in accordance to the [SPDX licence list](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Includes licences marked as either "FSF free/libre" or "OSI approved".

- `spdx-only-fsf` - a list created in accordance to the [SPDX licence list](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Includes only licences marked as "FSF free/libre".

- `spdx-only-osi` - a list created in accordance to the [SPDX licence list](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Includes only licences marked as "OSI approved".

- `suse` - a list created in accordance to [openSUSE packaging guidelines](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines#Licensing).

- `tweaked` - a list that combines all of the above and also includes many non-standard licence tags spotted in the wild.
This list has the smallest chance of generating false-positives (free packages being marked as non-free)

When building the program, one of those lists has to be selected as the default.
This can be done by providing the `DEFAULT_LICENCE_LIST` variable to *make*.


**Building**
----------
To build, use `make` with the `build` target. The `PREFIX` variable can be
used for controlling program data paths (e.g. where to look for the good licence list).
The default is `/usr/local`.

By default, *vrms-rpm* links against `librpm` and `librpmio`, to make use of RPM's version comparison functions.
To disable this feature, you can set the `WITH_LIBRPM` variable to `0`. In this case, *vrms-rpm* will use a fallback,
simplified algorithm when comparing package versions.
```
$ make build [PREFIX=/usr/local] [DEFAULT_LICENCE_LIST=tweaked] [WITH_LIBRPM=1]
```


**Testing**
----------
To test the program, use `make` with the `test` target. This will build the test suite and immediately execute it.
If you want to just build the test suite, use the `build/test-suite` target.
```
# Shorthand for: make build/test-suite && ./build/test-suite
$ make test
```
The test suite uses [*cmocka*](https://cmocka.org/), so make sure you have it installed.
If you build against `librpm`, you may notice that some tests are skipped;
these check *vrms-rpms's* fallback behaviour, so it makes no sense to run them when that's disabled.


**Installing**
----------
To install, perform your usual `make install`.
You can use the `DESTDIR` variable if you need to install the files
somewhere else than `PREFIX` dictates (e.g. for packaging).
```
$ [sudo] make install [PREFIX=/usr/local] [DESTDIR=]
```
Remember that to install stuff inside `/usr` you will need root capabilities.


**Getting rid of it**
----------
Should you decide to remove the program, the Makefile has got you covered.
```
$ [sudo] make remove [PREFIX=/usr/local] [DESTDIR=]
```
Once again, remember that messing inside `/usr` requires extra privileges.
